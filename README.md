# UDP-Shooter

This is a test example to play around with udp server and clients and to do some syncronization between them.
This is the very first version to do so. In future projects it would make sense to only send commands to the 
server and handle the reaction to this on the server.

Start server with:

> python server/server.py

Create clients with:

> python client/main.py
